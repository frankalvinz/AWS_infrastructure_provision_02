Using AWS's Terraform (Cloud9), this project automates the creation of a secure and scalable environment (VPC, SG, EC2) for hosting applications, emphasizing efficiency and repeatability.

The setup includes a VPC with public and private subnets, a NAT Gateway for internet access, a security group with SSH and HTTP rules, and EC2 instances deployed in user-specified subnets.
